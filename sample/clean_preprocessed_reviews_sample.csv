 I never thought I de be saying this because I had very high expectations about this hotel it is just 150 metres away from the underground station the neighborhood is quiet and lovely and the hotel looks really AMAZING on the inside yet the service is terrible It seems more one of a cheap hostel rather than one of a four stars hotel Here s why One day I asked the receptionist if it was possible to heat a pizza in the microwave of the kitchen He said it was not a problem and so I went out got a pizza and came back at the hotel There one of his colleagues they do not provide that kind of service and so I had to literally throw the pizza in the rubbish and it was 11 00 pm back then so it was all closed and I was STARVING so I had to wait for the very next day to eat something The air conditioning in my room made a terrible noise I don t know if it was broken or something and it was impossible to sleep Every night I had to turn on the tv to cover that annoying noise and fall asleep The next day I was in a rush and I needed one more toilet paper and a toothbrush so I went down at the reception asked for it and it took them 40 minutes to bring me wait for it only the toilet paper I had to wait 15 minutes more for a simple toothbrush How crazy Moving the bed for picking up an earring that accidentally fell on the floor I found two hair pins which where obviously not mine The room wasn t clean enough Last but not least on the day of my check out at about 10 00 am more or less I was making my luggages and the waitress roughly got into my room using her pass WITHOUT EVEN KNOCKING ON THE DOOR FIRST What I mean W H A T What if I was getting dressed or just anything else I was with my mom that morning and she was furious UNACCEPTABLE  ,Bad_review,0,thought de saying high expectations hotel metres away underground station neighborhood quiet lovely hotel looks amazing inside service terrible cheap hostel stars hotel day asked receptionist possible heat pizza microwave kitchen said problem went got pizza came hotel colleagues provide kind service literally throw pizza rubbish pm closed starving wait day eat air conditioning room terrible noise don know broken impossible sleep night turn tv cover annoying noise fall asleep day rush needed toilet paper toothbrush went reception asked took minutes bring wait toilet paper wait minutes simple toothbrush crazy moving bed picking earring accidentally fell floor found hair pins obviously room wasn clean day check making luggages waitress roughly got room pass knocking door mean getting dressed mom morning furious unacceptable
